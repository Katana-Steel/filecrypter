The quick and dirty installation guide is:
qmake
make
- Unix only
su
./install.sh
- on Windows run these commands in QT command prompt

In teory on a unix machine with a bash shell you should be able 
to build and install filecrypter using only the 'install.sh' 
script.

This should work on mac also, however I don't own a mac to test
this. In any case look to the QT documentation on how to build
QT applications on your platform.

It is assumed that you have Qt 4.2 or higher install including
the header/development packages or what ever is relevent for
building Qt applications. As this application uses CleanLooks
style which is added in QT 4.2.

to run the application on unix
open a terminal and enter:
# filecrypter
